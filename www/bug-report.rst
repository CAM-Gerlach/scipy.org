Report Bugs
===========
**Please help us by reporting any problems you find.**

Projects in the SciPy Stack all have their own bug trackers, on which issues
can be reported.  Questions and feature requests are best sent to the mailing
list of the project it concerns.  Trackers:

   - `NumPy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`_

   - `SciPy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues>`_
   
   - `Matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues>`_

   - `IPython <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues>`_

   - `Pandas <https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues>`_

   - `SymPy <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list>`_
