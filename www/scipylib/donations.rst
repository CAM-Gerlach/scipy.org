Support SciPy development
-------------------------

SciPy will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and
released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.  While we have a
large amount of `contributors <http://www.ohloh.net/p/scipy/contributors>`_ who
volunteer their time to improve SciPy, financial resources are needed to run
the project and accelerate its development.  If you have found SciPy to be
useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to
the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps!

All donations will be used strictly to fund SciPy development, by supporting
activities such as developer sprints, documentation and maintenance work, and
paying for hosting costs of servers and build slaves.

Our donations are managed by the `NumFOCUS`_ foundation, which passes 9X% of your
contribution to the SciPy project, and provides the SciPy development team with
basic administrative and legal services for the other X%.  NumFOCUS is a
501(c)3 non-profit foundation, so if you are subject to US Tax law, your
contributions will be tax-deductible.
